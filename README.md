# FinalProject
Immigration &amp; Revitalization in Philadelphia

This project will explore the changing demographics in Philadelphia as it relates to native- and foreign-born communities. I will look at place of origin for both communities in the decades between 1970 and 2010. I will make use of data provided by the Longitudinal Tract Database (LTDB) and National Historic GIS (NHGIS) to explore migration patterns and demographic shifts. Although the text of this project is specific to Philadlephia, the script is written in such a way that the charts and tables can show any county by changing the values of the first two variables ("stateFIPS" and "countyFIPS"). I hope this project will have longevity beyond the scope of this class and that it will spark new lines of inquiry for government officials, policy makers, and academics. It is my hope that this will help to strengthen the relationships between foreign-born residents and the areas in which they live. 

Please do not use this in any way that would isolate or persecute a group of individuals.
